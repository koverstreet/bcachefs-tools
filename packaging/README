==== liburcu requirement ====

https://liburcu.org/ is needed for this software to work, but older RHEL/CentOS and other
distros might not have a reliable install. You might have to do the following...

1. Make & install the latest liburcu tarball from their site.
2. In the Makefile for bcachefs-tools...
   a. Remove liburcu from PKGCONFIG_LIBS
   b. Add -lurcu to LDLIBS
3. Add LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib to /etc/environment
4. Remove "BuildRequires:  userspace-rcu-devel" and "Requires:   userspace-rcu" from the
   spec file here.

==== RHEL-CentOS 7 ====

You need to use https://www.softwarecollections.org/ to install a newer GCC.

As root: yum install devtoolset-8-gcc

Before building: scl enable devtoolset-8 bash

===== RHEL-CentOS (any) ====

1. As root, "yum install rpmdevtools help2man"
2. Make a non-root user to build RPMs with.
3. "su - (non-root user)" and use "rpmdev-setuptree" to create an RPM build structure.
4. Copy the SPEC file from this directory to the "~/rpmbuild/SPECS/" folder.
6. Move the parent directory here to bcachefs-tools-(VERSION), and "cd" to its parent.
7. "tar cjf bcachefs-tools-(VERSION).tar.bz2 (directory of bcachefs-tools-(VERSION))"
8. "rpmbuild -bs ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/bcachefs-tools.spec"
9. "rpmbuild -bb ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/bcachefs-tools.spec"
10. The RPMs will be in "~/rpmbuild/RPMS" and "~/rpmbuild/SRPMS".
